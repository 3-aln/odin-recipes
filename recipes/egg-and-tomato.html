  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Here’s a quick and simple dish many people from China will be very familiar with from their childhood. The combo might seem strange at first, but give it a try and you’ll find it’s a savoury and sweet (or tangy) delight that’s perfect over a steamy bowl of rice.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>4 tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 green onion</li>
    <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. cooking oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Slice tomatoes into wedges and chop scallions.</li>
    <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, beat and mix with 1/4 tsp. salt and sesame oil.</li>
    <li>In a pan, heat oil over medium-high heat and scramble eggs. Remove and set aside when nearly done.</li>
    <li>Add more oil into pan (if needed), add tomatoes and green onions. Stir occasionally. Cook for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add water, sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt. Stir well.</li>
    <li>Return eggs to the pan and stir.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook until tomatoes are slightly wilted and juices are released (1–2 minutes).</li>
    <li>Uncover and continue to cook until sauce is at preferred thickness.</li>
    <li>Serve over rice!</li>
  </ol>
