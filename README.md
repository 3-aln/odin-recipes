View the website at: https://3-aln.github.io/odin-recipes/

This is a simple pure-HTML website containing some recipes I like.

The following are some skills I demonstrated through completing this project.

Basic HTML:
* Using absolute and relative links.
* Using ordered and unordered lists.
* Using other basic HTML elements, like paragraphs, headings, and images.

Basic CSS:
* Using type and class selectors, along with grouping selectors and descendant combinators.
* Styling text, links with font properties (font family, weight, size, style).
* Adding colours to various elements (text, links, backgrounds).
